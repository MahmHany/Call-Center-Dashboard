<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project is a Call Center Dashboard, designed to provide insights into call center performance through an interactive and visually engaging interface. The dashboard offers an overview of call statistics, filtering options, and detailed breakdowns based on various parameters such as time, location, sentiment, and reason for calls. It is structured into two main views: a graphical dashboard and a detailed data grid.
